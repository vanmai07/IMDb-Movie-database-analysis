# IMDb-Movie-database-analysis
In this project, I will explore the most famous database about movies: IMDb. It is gathering millions of data about movies, directors, actors, characters with their award, review, ranking, review, revenue, etc!

In January 2020, IMDb has approximately 6.5 million titles and 83 million registered users. 

This project is about loading and manipulating this massive database 👍 and discovering cool info about movies, directors, characters or about the industry in general! Let’s go 🙂
